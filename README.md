# DeFi Project

## Overview
This project is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that integrates decentralized financial services into an eCommerce ecosystem. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, the platform allows for seamless crypto payments, staking rewards, and DeFi-based lending, offering users a decentralized, transparent, and accessible financial experience.

## Features
- **Crypto Payments**: Accept payments in major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.
- **Staking & Rewards**: Customers can stake tokens and earn rewards for their participation.
- **Lending & Borrowing**: Enable decentralized lending and borrowing mechanisms, allowing customers to access “buy now, pay later” options using crypto.
- **Governance**: Introduce a governance token, enabling users to vote on platform improvements and features.
- **NFT Integration**: Support NFTs as part of loyalty programs and exclusive rewards.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum / Binance Smart Chain / Polygon (choose as applicable)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: React, Material UI / Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Crypto Wallet Integration**: MetaMask, WalletConnect
- **Payment Processor**: Coinbase Commerce / BitPay (or custom)
- **Token Standard**: ERC-20 / BEP-20

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v16+)
- MetaMask browser extension
- Truffle or Hardhat (for smart contract development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahin-hub/DeFi_Dev.git
   cd DeFi_Dev
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
## Usage

### Wallet Integration
- Users can connect their wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect) to the platform to make purchases, stake tokens, or participate in lending/borrowing.

### Staking & Rewards
- Users can stake native tokens to earn platform rewards, such as discounts on products or cashback.

### DeFi Lending
- Users can borrow crypto assets by providing collateral or use "buy now, pay later" options through integrated DeFi lending protocols.

### Governance
- Token holders can participate in the platform's governance by proposing and voting on new features, changes, or improvements.

## Smart Contracts
The smart contracts for this project are written in Solidity and handle:
- Crypto payments
- Staking and rewards distribution
- DeFi lending functionality
- Governance mechanisms

### Contract Addresses
- Main Contract: `0x...` (replace with actual deployed address)
- Governance Token Contract: `0x...`
